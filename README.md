# Spendings-spreedshets
Automated spreadsheet to log spendings and filter them by categories. It essentially helps you identify where your money is going. You can access the spreadsheet then in google sheets go to extensions>appscript and paste the code. Then when you reload the spreadsheet you should see where it says "functions" beside help on the navegation menu. Once you click it you can run the monthly sum code which will list the totals from each month to the right of the spreadsheet. This is a work in progress and I plan to filter which entry was "necesassary" or not. The goal is that on the subspreadsheet named "totals" you can see a bar chart with all the money you spent and consider if you spent more necessary money or innecessary money, as well as note in which category you spent the most money on. This will also help in tax season to understand which spendings you can claim.
